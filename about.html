        This website was initially built for my girlfriend in 2024. She used to
        jot down her weekly tasks using mediums such as Word and random scraps of
        paper. I thought it would be nice to build a cutesy, simple site so she
        could keep all her plans in one place.
      </p>

        After pushing it to the web, I realised that I used the site as much as
        she does! Something I always struggled with was planning meals so I
        thought a nice addition to the weekly planner would be a
        <strong><a href="food-planner.html">meal plan</a></strong> as well.
